Today our team reviewed our prior days work and talked about what we needed to do. I was able to test my currency exchange rate API to confirm it worked but now I need to create a function that only returns the from, to, amount, result and date. I am having trouble creating a function to complete this task but I will continue to research Fast APIs and react to resolve this.

Today our team set up docker by creating microservices for each API we need to use and the src code. With the help of SEIRS we were able to get the ports up and running.
