Today I was able to get my API function running to return only the "result" data from the API call with the help of my team. I didn't realize before that I already had the return value that I wanted but I just didn't know how to turn it into a callable function. 

I started working on unit testing for my functions and got 1 of them to work. I'm having issues with the second unit test because it wont accurately compare the result which is a float to the test result in my test. On my end I see that they are both floats so I would assume the assertion that both items equalled would be valid but I guess not. I'll keep researching how to fix that and touch base with a SEIR if I cant figure it out.

Today our team reviewed our prior days work and talked about what we needed to do. I was able to test my currency exchange rate API to confirm it worked but now I need to create a function that only returns the from, to, amount, result and date. I am having trouble creating a function to complete this task but I will continue to research Fast APIs and react to resolve this.

Today our team set up docker by creating microservices for each API we need to use and the src code. With the help of SEIRS we were able to get the ports up and running.
