Today, I worked on:
* creating Dockerfile.dev modules for Weather, Currency, and Flights APIs.
* creating docker-compose.yml incorporating the above as well as React
* getting the weather api up and running

The group and I discussed whether we wanted to use one microservice per API or whether we should combine them all into one. We went with the former in order to make the webapp as modular as possible. Thankfully, Docker makes this easy!

I recalled from the second module of the bootcamp that our API kees must be kept absolutely secret. I got a chance to dig around stack overflow and Docker docs to figure out how to accomplish this. If you add an .env module to the same directory as the docker-compose module, you can add environment variables which can be declared in the docker-compose using the syntax VARIABLE_NAME: ${VARIABLE_FROM_ENV}
