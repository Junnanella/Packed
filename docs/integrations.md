List of needed integrations: +

* Weather API
   - Will show historical data for weather so a user can 
    see what the weather may be like on their desired travel date/location 
   - Data will be shown to the user in months, so they can decide what time of year they would like to travel 
* Currency Exchange Rate API: 
    - Will provide the user with the current days exchange rate from USD to their desired location's currency
    - Since future exchange rates cannot be shown the user will use the current
    days exchange rate as a reference for a later date trip 
* Flight Price API: (still researching for a free one)
    - Our goal is for the API to show the user the current prices for flights to their desired location
    - This API will also help the user determine the cheapest flights and destinations if they do not have a desired location to travel in mind
