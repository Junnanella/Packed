On this page, the user can now start building their packing list, which is broken down into three sections:

- One section will be an input where the user can type any items of their choosing to add to the packing list.
- One section will have pre-loaded suggestions for basic travel items, like a toothbrush, that the user add to their packing list
- Last section will have pre-loaded suggestions for travel items based on location, like a coat for a cold region or swim suit for a tropical region, that the user add to their packing list
