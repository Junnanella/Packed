A website that provides a curated playlist based on a user's input such as mood, pictures, location, age etc. 

## Intended market

Target audience ranges in age from 13-65. This will most benefit people with a hard time finding new music to listen to and are sick of hearing the same 5 songs. 

## Functionality

* Can find biggest hits based on a specific year 
* Adds visualizer background to music while it plays based on ...(still deciding)
* Can return a list of popular songs based off location 
* Leave short reviews on recommended songs 
* A user can give a like or a dislike to a song recommendation which would impact future recommendations 
* Users can share music with other users(too difficult?)
* Can return liked artists' concerts playing nearby
