Be sure to identify the api's you will be using to get the data you are referencing

- temp
- average round trip price
- exchange rate
- packing list items

Depending how open the api's are, you may have to go through an application process. One of my projects used the Twitter API and it took about 2 weeks to get approval from start to finish. Your API experience may vary.
