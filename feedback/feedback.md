We'll do our best to keep this in reverse-chronological order, with new comments towards the top.

Be sure to identify the api's you will be using to get the data you are referencing

- temp -- https://openweathermap.org/api
- average round trip price -- ??
- exchange rate -- https://polygon.io/stocks?gclid=CjwKCAjwiJqWBhBdEiwAtESPaHhajhSsF6GYMCMmso1-clUmhHdFaly8W-Z4NqcChJKIZZpbprZI-xoCukwQAvD_BwE#stocks-product-cards
- packing list items -- our own api called packing_list which will be expounded upon in the data-model.md module

Depending how open the api's are, you may have to go through an application process. One of my projects used the Twitter API and it took about 2 weeks to get approval from start to finish. Your API experience may vary.
